🍳 Kitchen Hub: Interactive Smart Home Dashboard

A centralized, interactive smart-calendar and appliance hub designed for modern kitchens. This project serves as a comprehensive study in CSS Grid, Responsive Design, and User Experience (UX).

🚀 The Vision

The Kitchen Hub is more than just a calendar; it’s a digital command center. Built as part of my journey through The Odin Project, this application focuses on providing a glanceable, touch-friendly interface for families to manage their schedules, inventory, and daily environment.

✨ Key Features

Weather-Adaptive UI: The background dynamically updates (Cloudy, Rainy, Sunny) based on real-time weather data.

Advanced Smart Calendar: * One-touch "Plus" buttons to add events.

Event prioritization (Birthdays and High-Priority alerts).

"Multi-event" indicators for busy days.

Adaptive Night Mode: A warm-spectrum theme for low-light kitchen environments.

Personalization Engine: Support for multiple user profiles with saved layout preferences.

Kitchen Utilities: Integrated timer hub, unit converter, and grocery inventory tracking.

🛠 Tech Stack (Planned)

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Grid & Flexbox), JavaScript (ES6+)

Styling: Custom CSS Variables for dynamic theming and animations.

API Integration: OpenWeatherMap API for environmental syncing.

Storage: LocalStorage (Initial) transitioning to a Backend Database (Future).

📐 Architecture & Design

The layout follows a strict Modular Grid system:

Header: Real-time clock and "Half-Moon" expanding weather widget.

Sidebars: Quick-access personal apps and system utilities.

Main Body: Interactive calendar with hover-state menus.

Footer: System notifications and power management.
