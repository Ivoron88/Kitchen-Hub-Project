🗺️ The Kitchen Hub Master Roadmap
Phase 1: Structural Foundation (HTML)
Goal: Create the "Bones" of the site without worrying about looks.

[ ] Boilerplate Setup: Create index.html, link your style.css, and set up the <head> metadata.

[ ] Semantic Mapping: Use <header>, <main>, <aside>, and <footer> tags to define the big zones.

[ ] Containerization: Create div containers for every "box" in your sketch (Weather, Clock, Calendar, App Sidebar).

[ ] Content Injection: Add placeholder text and icons (use FontAwesome or SVG icons) for all buttons.

[ ] Accessibility Check: Ensure all images have alt text and buttons have descriptive names for screen readers.

Phase 2: Visual Architecture (CSS)
Goal: Make the layout match your sketch exactly using "Box" logic.

[ ] The Global Grid: Define the main display: grid layout for the whole screen.

[ ] Component Layouts: Use Flexbox to align items inside the header and sidebars (centering the clock, stacking the app buttons).

[ ] The Calendar Grid: Build a sub-grid specifically for the 31-day view.

[ ] Visual Polish: Add your borders, background colors, and Google Fonts to match your "Kitchen Hub" aesthetic.

[ ] Responsive Design: Use Media Queries to make sure the hub looks good if the window is resized.

Phase 3: Interactive Styling (Advanced CSS)
Goal: Add the "Feel" and "Motion" you described.

[ ] Hover & Active States: Add transitions so buttons glow or change size when touched/hovered.

[ ] The Half-Moon Reveal: Research and implement clip-path or transform to make the weather section expand.

[ ] Theme Variables: Set up CSS Variables (e.g., --main-bg) so you can easily toggle "Night Mode" later.

[ ] Animated Elements: Create a @keyframes animation for your settings cogwheel so it spins.

Phase 4: Dynamic Logic (JavaScript)
Goal: Make it actually work.

[ ] The Live Clock: Write a function that updates the time every second.

[ ] Dynamic Calendar: Write logic to display the correct dates for the current month automatically.

[ ] Event Handling: Create "Click Listeners" so that clicking a plus sign opens a window to type in a new event.

[ ] Weather API Integration: - Research: Learn how to use fetch() to get data from OpenWeatherMap.

Implementation: Change the background image class based on the "Condition" (e.g., if (rain) { bg.addClass('rainy') }).

Phase 5: Testing & Refinement
Goal: Break it so you can fix it.

[ ] Cross-Browser Testing: Open your hub in Chrome, Firefox, and on your phone to see if it breaks.

[ ] Edge Case Check: What happens to the calendar if a month has 31 days? What if a day has 10 events?

[ ] Performance Check: Ensure your weather images aren't too large (which slows down the site).

🔍 Where to Research (The "Developer's Library")
When you get to a specific feature, here is where you should look:

For Layout (Grid/Flexbox): * Reference: MDN Web Docs (The gold standard for "how does this property work?").

Fun Practice: Flexbox Froggy or Grid Garden (Games to master the logic).

For Animations (Weather/Expansion): * Inspiration: CodePen.io (Search for "CSS Rain Animation" or "Expanding Card").

For API & JavaScript: * The "Why": The Odin Project (Go back to the 'Working with APIs' section).

The "How": YouTube (Kevin Powell) for CSS or Web Dev Simplified for JS logic.

For Design/Icons: * Icons: Lucide Icons or Font Awesome.

Colors: Coolors.co to generate your "Kitchen" color palette.
